## TaskLeef CLI

your API key is in ~/.todo.claude.auth to use it pass it to the todo CLI

`todo --auth-file ~/.todo.claude.auth <commands>`

If you ever have a question about syntax use `todo help` to check

## Codebase Notes

The todo CLI command has moved to ~/code/taskleef-cli

We don't use Docker for local development. Instead we have a local instance of postgres 15 running.
We do use Docker to deploy to production
The production deployment code is located in ~/code/infrastructure/envs/production
